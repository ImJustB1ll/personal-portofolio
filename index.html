            <h1>Hi! I'm <span>Billy</span></h1>
            <h3>IT Support</h3>
            <p>I'm an IT student from SMK Pariwisata Metland School in West Java, Indonesia, with a strong interest in game development, hardware, and IT support.
            I’m currently focused on learning technical support, hardware troubleshooting, and systems maintenance to build a solid foundation in the tech industry.
            Passionate about turning ideas into reality through technology — whether it’s fixing hardware, supporting users, or building digital experiences.
            I'm looking forward to gaining real-world experience and growing my skills to eventually pursue a career in game development.</p>
